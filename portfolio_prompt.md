Build a portfolio page in one single HTML file, with internal CSS and JavaScript to showcase my work and skills.

I want a dark theme, with black background and white text and some grey elements. 

The font should be mostly Inter, and one section on Jetbrains mono or similar. 

Start with a page container of 960px max width. The header must have my name on the left side with 16px bold. 

The nav should be on the right side 16px regular and 48px of gap between the nav items. 

The hero starts with my photo on the left side in a 64 x 64 px circle: https://framerusercontent.com/images/OCUTLDUkLBhD8HfrnwigMoA3gpU.jpeg?width=800&height=800

To the right of the circle, add this text in 14px regular Jetbrains mono and 340px max width: “Hi, I'm Apoorv, designing products, brands, and stories end to end, full stack creative.” 

Add a hero image below, 864 x 242 aspect ratio, 64px padding top and bottom: https://framerusercontent.com/images/sUQN9ZSGjn0hS9Ri7pMnpG0nRU.png

Below the hero image add the title in Inter 80px: “Product and Brand Designer”.
